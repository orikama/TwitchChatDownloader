# TwitchChatDownloader (WIP)
Download chat logs from past broadcasts on Twitch.tv  
[Twitch-Chat-Downloader](https://github.com/PetterKraabol/Twitch-Chat-Downloader) was too slow for me. So I decided to make my own, with concurrent logs downloading.

## Building environment
Visual Studio 2019 16.7  
.Net v5.0.0-preview.7

## Dependencies
`System.CommandLine` [![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/System.CommandLine.svg)](https://nuget.org/packages/System.CommandLine)
